# Deepfake Image Detector

This project implements a **Deepfake Image Classification System** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **transfer learning** with **EfficientNetB0**. It is trained on the "Real and Fake Face Detection" dataset from Kaggle and provides a user-friendly web interface using **Gradio** for real-time classification.

## Overview

Deepfakes have emerged as a major concern in the digital age, with increasing use in misinformation and identity fraud. This project aims to build a deep learning-based classifier to distinguish between real and AI-generated (fake) human faces using image classification.

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* EfficientNetB0 (Transfer Learning)
* OpenCV
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Gradio
* KaggleHub

---

## Dataset

* **Name:** Real and Fake Face Detection
* **Source:** [Kaggle Dataset - ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection)
* **Contents:**

  * `training_real`: Real human face images
  * `training_fake`: AI-generated human face images

The dataset was downloaded and prepared using the `kagglehub` library.

---

## Model Architecture

* **Backbone:** EfficientNetB0 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
* **Custom Layers:**

  * Global Average Pooling
  * Dense Layer with L2 Regularization
  * Batch Normalization
  * Dropout
  * Softmax Output Layer (2 classes: Real, Fake)

Only the top 20 layers of EfficientNetB0 were made trainable to fine-tune the model.

---

## Training Details

* **Input Size:** 224x224 RGB images
* **Augmentation:** ImageDataGenerator with rotation, shift, zoom, flip, brightness, and channel shift
* **Optimizer:** Adam
* **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy with label smoothing
* **Callbacks Used:**

  * ModelCheckpoint
  * EarlyStopping
  * ReduceLROnPlateau
* **Class Weighting:** Used to handle class imbalance
* **Epochs:** 10
* **Batch Size:** 16

Note: Due to limited patience, the model was only trained for 10 epochs, achieving an accuracy of 0.8078. With more epochs, the model could potentially achieve better prediction performance.

---

## Performance

Training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted using `matplotlib`. The model is saved as `deepfake_cnn.h5` for future inference.

---

## Gradio Interface

A lightweight and interactive Gradio UI allows users to upload an image and receive a prediction of whether the face is real or fake.

* **Input:** Image file (PNG, JPG)
* **Output:** Class probabilities for Real and Fake
* **Framework:** Gradio

---

   ```bash
   pip install kagglehub gradio tensorflow matplotlib
   ```

2. **Download Dataset and Train the Model:**
