# Deepfake-Image-Detection-System
This project uses CNNs with EfficientNetB0 transfer learning for binary deepfake image classification. It incorporates data augmentation, label smoothing, and class rebalancing techniques to enhance generalization. A Gradio interface enables real-time inference to distinguish between authentic and synthetically generated facial images.
